          </AccordionSummary>
          <AccordionDetails className='bg-primary bg-opacity-50 text-white'>
            Yes! Tortoises can recognize their owners. While they don't show affection in the same way as mammals, they can learn to associate their owner with food and care. Over time, a tortoise may become more comfortable around a familiar person, showing signs of recognition by approaching them, following them, or becoming more relaxed in their presence. Some tortoise owners even report their pets responding to their voice or touch. However, this recognition is more based on routine and association rather than deep emotional attachment.

          <AccordionDetails className='bg-primary bg-opacity-50 text-white'>
            Tortoises can be good pets for beginners, but they require a lot of commitment and care. Unlike traditional pets like cats or dogs, tortoises have specific habitat, diet, and temperature needs. For beginners, smaller and hardier species like the Russian tortoise or Hermannâ€™s tortoise are recommended. They are not the best choice for those looking for an interactive or affectionate pet.

          </AccordionSummary>
          <AccordionDetails className='bg-primary bg-opacity-50 text-white'>
            Tortoises are generally solitary animals and do not require companionship. In the wild, they live alone and only interact with others for mating. Unlike social animals, tortoises do not experience loneliness in the way that mammals might. In captivity, keeping multiple tortoises together can sometimes lead to stress, competition for food, or even aggression, especially among males.

            Determining the exact age of a tortoise can be challenging, but there are a few methods that can help estimate its age: <br /> <span className='text-primary font-bold'>1.</span> Counting the Growth Rings on the Shell: Tortoises grow by adding layers to their shells, and these layers (called scutes) often have growth rings, similar to the rings of a tree. The rings are more visible in younger tortoises, but they become less pronounced as the tortoise matures. <br />
            <span className='text-primary font-bold'>2.</span>  Size and Weight: Tortoises grow at different rates depending on their species, but younger tortoises generally have a smaller size and lighter weight. <br />
            <span className='text-primary font-bold'>3.</span> Observing Behavior and Maturity: Young tortoises are typically more active and curious, while older tortoises tend to be less active and more sedentary.

          <AccordionDetails className='bg-primary bg-opacity-50 text-white'>
            Tortoises are land-dwelling animals with dome-shaped shells, while turtles are mostly aquatic, with flatter shells and webbed feet or flippers. Tortoises are herbivores, feeding mainly on plants, while turtles have a more varied diet, including plants, small animals, and fish. The key difference is that tortoises live on land, and turtles are adapted to life in water.

          <AccordionDetails className='bg-primary bg-opacity-50 text-white'>
            Tortoises are generally slow movers. They typically move at a speed of about 0.3 to 0.8 km/h, though some species can reach slightly higher speeds when necessary. Their slow pace is due to their heavy, protective shells and their land-based nature.

            No, tortoises do not have teeth. Instead, they have a sharp beak-like structure that they use to bite and cut their food. The edges of their beaks are adapted for their specific diet, whether it's plants or other food types.

          </AccordionSummary>
          <AccordionDetails className='bg-primary bg-opacity-50 text-white'>
            Tortoises protect themselves from predators primarily by retreating into their hard shells. Their shells act as a shield, providing protection from most threats. When a tortoise feels threatened, it can quickly withdraw its head, legs, and tail into the shell, closing the shell with a hard, impenetrable barrier. Some species of tortoises also have strong claws and can dig burrows to hide from predators. Tortoises have predators such as: large birds, snakes, lions, hyenas and crocodiles.

          <AccordionDetails className='bg-primary bg-opacity-50 text-white'>
            Tortoises are generally not strong swimmers. Unlike turtles, which are adapted for swimming, tortoises are land animals and are not built for life in the water.
            However, some species of tortoises can swim short distances if needed, especially if they are in shallow water or in danger. They can use their legs to paddle, but they are not as efficient in water as turtles.
