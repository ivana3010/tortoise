        text:'Creating the perfect terrarium for your tortoise is key to ensuring their comfort and well-being. The first thing to consider is the size of terrarium. Ensure that it is spacious enough for your tortoise to move around comfortably. A good rule of thumb is to provide at least 10 square feet of space for an adult tortoise. It’s important to use a mix of organic soil, coconut coir, and sand. This combination allows your tortoise to dig and burrow, which is essential for their natural behavior. Proper humidity is also critical, as it helps prevent shell pyramiding and supports hydration. Lightly mist the substrate and your tortoise’s shell daily. In your tortoise’s terrarium, you could include plants like dandelions, clover, and grasses. These are not only decorative, but also provide a source of food. Adding rocks and leaves will help create hiding spots and offer climbing opportunities, which will enrich the environment and keep your tortoise mentally stimulated.',

It mimics natural sunlight and helps them produce vitamin D3, which is necessary for calcium absorption and shell health. You should place a UVB bulb over the basking area to ensure your tortoise can bask directly underneath it. If possible, try to provide natural sunlight for your tortoise. Exposure to natural sunlight for 15-30 minutes a day is ideal for ensuring optimal UVB levels.',

You can find tips for a healthy tortoise diet on the Food page. Avoid feeding them high-protein foods  because this can cause health issues in the long run. In addition to regular food, you should provide calcium and vitamin D3 supplements to support their shell and bone health.',

        label: 'Hydration',
        text:'Proper hydration is incredibly important for tortoises. A great way to ensure hydration is by soaking tortoise in shallow, lukewarm water for 15-30 minutes a few times a week. This process helps with digestion and hydration. In addition to soaking, always provide fresh water in a shallow dish in the terrarium. Be sure to change the water daily to prevent bacterial growth and ensure your tortoise has access to clean water at all times. It’s also essential to maintain proper humidity in the terrarium, aiming for a humidity level of 30-40%. This will help your tortoise remain hydrated and promote a healthy shell.',

        label: 'Hibernation',
        text:'Hibernation is a natural process for some tortoise species, though not all tortoises will hibernate. If your tortoise is one that does, it’s important to prepare them properly. Before hibernating, make sure your tortoise is healthy and has enough fat reserves to survive the period without food. During hibernation, keep the temperature of the area between 40-55°F (4.5-13°C), as this is the ideal range for most tortoises. Tortoises that are kept indoors are often hibernated in a controlled environment, such as a dedicated refrigerator used only for this purpose. The duration of hibernation can vary, but it typically lasts between 2 to 5 months. It’s important to monitor your tortoise’s health regularly during this time.Once your tortoise has emerged from hibernation, gradually warm them up and offer fresh water to help them rehydrate. It’s also a good idea to provide food at this stage to help them regain their strength.',
